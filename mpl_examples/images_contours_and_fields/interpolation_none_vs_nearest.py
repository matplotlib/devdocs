"""
Displays the difference between interpolation = 'none' and
interpolation = 'nearest'.

Interpolation = 'none' and interpolation = 'nearest' are equivalent when
converting a figure to an image file, such as a PNG.
Interpolation = 'none' and interpolation = 'nearest' behave quite
differently, however, when converting a figure to a vector graphics file,
such as a PDF.  As shown, Interpolation = 'none' works well when a big
image is scaled down, while interpolation = 'nearest' works well when a
small image is blown up.
