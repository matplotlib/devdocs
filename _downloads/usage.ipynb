        "\n***********\nUsage Guide\n***********\n\nThis tutorial covers some basic usage patterns and best-practices to\nhelp you get started with Matplotlib.\n\n\nGeneral Concepts\n================\n\n:mod:`matplotlib` has an extensive codebase that can be daunting to many\nnew users. However, most of matplotlib can be understood with a fairly\nsimple conceptual framework and knowledge of a few important points.\n\nPlotting requires action on a range of levels, from the most general\n(e.g., 'contour this 2-D array') to the most specific (e.g., 'color\nthis screen pixel red'). The purpose of a plotting package is to assist\nyou in visualizing your data as easily as possible, with all the necessary\ncontrol -- that is, by using relatively high-level commands most of\nthe time, and still have the ability to use the low-level commands when\nneeded.\n\nTherefore, everything in matplotlib is organized in a hierarchy. At the top\nof the hierarchy is the matplotlib \"state-machine environment\" which is\nprovided by the :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot` module. At this level, simple\nfunctions are used to add plot elements (lines, images, text, etc.) to\nthe current axes in the current figure.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Pyplot's state-machine environment behaves similarly to MATLAB and\n   should be most familiar to users with MATLAB experience.</p></div>\n\nThe next level down in the hierarchy is the first level of the object-oriented\ninterface, in which pyplot is used only for a few functions such as figure\ncreation, and the user explicitly creates and keeps track of the figure\nand axes objects. At this level, the user uses pyplot to create figures,\nand through those figures, one or more axes objects can be created. These\naxes objects are then used for most plotting actions.\n\nFor even more control -- which is essential for things like embedding\nmatplotlib plots in GUI applications -- the pyplot level may be dropped\ncompletely, leaving a purely object-oriented approach.\n\n"

        ":class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\n------------------------------\n\nThis is what you think of as 'a plot', it is the region of the image\nwith the data space (marked as the inner blue box).  A given figure\ncan contain many Axes, but a given :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes`\nobject can only be in one :class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure`.  The\nAxes contains two (or three in the case of 3D)\n:class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis` objects (be aware of the difference\nbetween **Axes** and **Axis**) which take care of the data limits (the\ndata limits can also be controlled via set via the\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlim` and\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_ylim` :class:`Axes` methods).  Each\n:class:`Axes` has a title (set via\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_title`), an x-label (set via\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlabel`), and a y-label set via\n:meth:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_ylabel`).\n\nThe :class:`Axes` class and it's member functions are the primary entry\npoint to working with the OO interface.\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.axis.Axis`\n------------------------------\n\nThese are the number-line-like objects (circled in green).  They take\ncare of setting the graph limits and generating the ticks (the marks\non the axis) and ticklabels (strings labeling the ticks).  The\nlocation of the ticks is determined by a\n:class:`~matplotlib.ticker.Locator` object and the ticklabel strings\nare formatted by a :class:`~matplotlib.ticker.Formatter`.  The\ncombination of the correct :class:`Locator` and :class:`Formatter` gives\nvery fine control over the tick locations and labels.\n\n:class:`~matplotlib.artist.Artist`\n----------------------------------\n\nBasically everything you can see on the figure is an artist (even the\n:class:`Figure`, :class:`Axes`, and :class:`Axis` objects).  This\nincludes :class:`Text` objects, :class:`Line2D` objects,\n:class:`collection` objects, :class:`Patch` objects ... (you get the\nidea).  When the figure is rendered, all of the artists are drawn to\nthe **canvas**.  Most Artists are tied to an Axes; such an Artist\ncannot be shared by multiple Axes, or moved from one to another.\n\n\nTypes of inputs to plotting functions\n=====================================\n\nAll of plotting functions expect `np.array` or `np.ma.masked_array` as\ninput.  Classes that are 'array-like' such as `pandas` data objects\nand `np.matrix` may or may not work as intended.  It is best to\nconvert these to `np.array` objects prior to plotting.\n\nFor example, to convert a `pandas.DataFrame` ::\n\n  a = pandas.DataFrame(np.random.rand(4,5), columns = list('abcde'))\n  a_asndarray = a.values\n\nand to covert a `np.matrix` ::\n\n  b = np.matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])\n  b_asarray = np.asarray(b)\n\n\nMatplotlib, pyplot and pylab: how are they related?\n====================================================\n\nMatplotlib is the whole package; :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot`\nis a module in matplotlib; and :mod:`pylab` is a module\nthat gets installed alongside :mod:`matplotlib`.\n\nPyplot provides the state-machine interface to the underlying\nobject-oriented plotting library.  The state-machine implicitly and\nautomatically creates figures and axes to achieve the desired\nplot. For example:\n\n"

Just about all of the examples can be\nconverted into another style and achieve the same results.\nThe only caveat is to avoid mixing the coding styles for your own code.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Developers for matplotlib have to follow a specific style and guidelines.\n   See `developers-guide-index`.</p></div>\n\nOf the different styles, there are two that are officially supported.\nTherefore, these are the preferred ways to use matplotlib.\n\nFor the pyplot style, the imports at the top of your\nscripts will typically be::\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    import numpy as np\n\nThen one calls, for example, np.arange, np.zeros, np.pi, plt.figure,\nplt.plot, plt.show, etc.  Use the pyplot interface\nfor creating figures, and then use the object methods for the rest:\n\n"

        "Again, for these simple examples this style seems like overkill, however\nonce the graphs get slightly more complex it pays off.\n\n\nWhat is a backend?\n==================\n\nA lot of documentation on the website and in the mailing lists refers\nto the \"backend\" and many new users are confused by this term.\nmatplotlib targets many different use cases and output formats.  Some\npeople use matplotlib interactively from the python shell and have\nplotting windows pop up when they type commands.  Some people embed\nmatplotlib into graphical user interfaces like wxpython or pygtk to\nbuild rich applications.  Others use matplotlib in batch scripts to\ngenerate postscript images from some numerical simulations, and still\nothers in web application servers to dynamically serve up graphs.\n\nTo support all of these use cases, matplotlib can target different\noutputs, and each of these capabilities is called a backend; the\n\"frontend\" is the user facing code, i.e., the plotting code, whereas the\n\"backend\" does all the hard work behind-the-scenes to make the figure.\nThere are two types of backends: user interface backends (for use in\npygtk, wxpython, tkinter, qt4, or macosx; also referred to as\n\"interactive backends\") and hardcopy backends to make image files\n(PNG, SVG, PDF, PS; also referred to as \"non-interactive backends\").\n\nThere are four ways to configure your backend. If they conflict each other,\nthe method mentioned last in the following list will be used, e.g. calling\n:func:`~matplotlib.use()` will override the setting in your ``matplotlibrc``.\n\n\n#. The ``backend`` parameter in your ``matplotlibrc`` file (see\n   `sphx_glr_tutorials_01_introductory_customizing.py`)::\n\n       backend : WXAgg   # use wxpython with antigrain (agg) rendering\n\n#. Setting the :envvar:`MPLBACKEND` environment\n   variable, either for your current shell or for a single script::\n\n        > export MPLBACKEND=\"module://my_backend\"\n        > python simple_plot.py\n\n        > MPLBACKEND=\"module://my_backend\" python simple_plot.py\n\n   Setting this environment variable will override the ``backend`` parameter\n   in *any* ``matplotlibrc``, even if there is a ``matplotlibrc`` in your\n   current working directory. Therefore setting :envvar:`MPLBACKEND`\n   globally, e.g. in your ``.bashrc`` or ``.profile``, is discouraged as it\n   might lead to counter-intuitive behavior.\n\n#. If your script depends on a specific backend you can use the\n   :func:`~matplotlib.use` function::\n\n      import matplotlib\n      matplotlib.use('PS')   # generate postscript output by default\n\n   If you use the :func:`~matplotlib.use` function, this must be done before\n   importing :mod:`matplotlib.pyplot`. Calling :func:`~matplotlib.use` after\n   pyplot has been imported will have no effect.  Using\n   :func:`~matplotlib.use` will require changes in your code if users want to\n   use a different backend.  Therefore, you should avoid explicitly calling\n   :func:`~matplotlib.use` unless absolutely necessary.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Backend name specifications are not case-sensitive; e.g., 'GTKAgg'\n   and 'gtkagg' are equivalent.</p></div>\n\nWith a typical installation of matplotlib, such as from a\nbinary installer or a linux distribution package, a good default\nbackend will already be set, allowing both interactive work and\nplotting from scripts, with output to the screen and/or to\na file, so at least initially you will not need to use any of the\nmethods given above.\n\nIf, however, you want to write graphical user interfaces, or a web\napplication server (`howto-webapp`), or need a better\nunderstanding of what is going on, read on. To make things a little\nmore customizable for graphical user interfaces, matplotlib separates\nthe concept of the renderer (the thing that actually does the drawing)\nfrom the canvas (the place where the drawing goes).  The canonical\nrenderer for user interfaces is ``Agg`` which uses the `Anti-Grain\nGeometry`_ C++ library to make a raster (pixel) image of the figure.\nAll of the user interfaces except ``macosx`` can be used with\nagg rendering, e.g.,\n``WXAgg``, ``GTKAgg``, ``QT4Agg``, ``QT5Agg``, ``TkAgg``.  In\naddition, some of the user interfaces support other rendering engines.\nFor example, with GTK, you can also select GDK rendering (backend\n``GTK`` deprecated in 2.0) or Cairo rendering (backend ``GTKCairo``).\n\nFor the rendering engines, one can also distinguish between `vector\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics>`_ or `raster\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics>`_ renderers.  Vector\ngraphics languages issue drawing commands like \"draw a line from this\npoint to this point\" and hence are scale free, and raster backends\ngenerate a pixel representation of the line whose accuracy depends on a\nDPI setting.\n\nHere is a summary of the matplotlib renderers (there is an eponymous\nbacked for each; these are *non-interactive backends*, capable of\nwriting to a file):\n\n=============   ============   ================================================\nRenderer        Filetypes      Description\n=============   ============   ================================================\n:term:`AGG`     :term:`png`    :term:`raster graphics` -- high quality images\n                               using the `Anti-Grain Geometry`_ engine\nPS              :term:`ps`     :term:`vector graphics` -- Postscript_ output\n                :term:`eps`\nPDF             :term:`pdf`    :term:`vector graphics` --\n                               `Portable Document Format`_\nSVG             :term:`svg`    :term:`vector graphics` --\n                               `Scalable Vector Graphics`_\n:term:`Cairo`   :term:`png`    :term:`vector graphics` --\n                :term:`ps`     `Cairo graphics`_\n                :term:`pdf`\n                :term:`svg`\n                ...\n:term:`GDK`     :term:`png`    :term:`raster graphics` --\n                :term:`jpg`    the `Gimp Drawing Kit`_ Deprecated in 2.0\n                :term:`tiff`\n                ...\n=============   ============   ================================================\n\nAnd here are the user interfaces and renderer combinations supported;\nthese are *interactive backends*, capable of displaying to the screen\nand of using appropriate renderers from the table above to write to\na file:\n\n============   ================================================================\nBackend        Description\n============   ================================================================\nGTKAgg         Agg rendering to a :term:`GTK` 2.x canvas (requires PyGTK_ and\n               pycairo_ or cairocffi_; Python2 only)\nGTK3Agg        Agg rendering to a :term:`GTK` 3.x canvas (requires PyGObject_\n               and pycairo_ or cairocffi_)\nGTK            GDK rendering to a :term:`GTK` 2.x canvas (not recommended and d\n               eprecated in 2.0) (requires PyGTK_ and pycairo_ or cairocffi_;\n               Python2 only)\nGTKCairo       Cairo rendering to a :term:`GTK` 2.x canvas (requires PyGTK_\n               and pycairo_ or cairocffi_; Python2 only)\nGTK3Cairo      Cairo rendering to a :term:`GTK` 3.x canvas (requires PyGObject_\n               and pycairo_ or cairocffi_)\nWXAgg          Agg rendering to a :term:`wxWidgets` canvas\n               (requires wxPython_)\nWX             Native :term:`wxWidgets` drawing to a :term:`wxWidgets` Canvas\n               (not recommended and deprecated in 2.0) (requires wxPython_)\nTkAgg          Agg rendering to a :term:`Tk` canvas (requires TkInter_)\nQt4Agg         Agg rendering to a :term:`Qt4` canvas (requires PyQt4_ or ``pyside``)\nQt5Agg         Agg rendering in a :term:`Qt5` canvas (requires PyQt5_)\nmacosx         Cocoa rendering in OSX windows\n               (presently lacks blocking show() behavior when matplotlib\n               is in non-interactive mode)\n============   ================================================================\n\n\nWX backends\n===========\n\nAt present the release version of `wxPython` (also known as wxPython classic)\ndoes not support python3. A work in progress redesigned version known as\nwxPython-Phoenix_ does support python3.\nMatplotlib should work with both versions.\n\n\nGTK and Cairo\n=============\n\nBoth `GTK2` and `GTK3` have implicit dependencies on PyCairo regardless of the\nspecific Matplotlib backend used. Unfortunatly the latest release of PyCairo\nfor Python3 does not implement the Python wrappers needed for the `GTK3Agg`\nbackend. `Cairocffi` can be used as a replacement which implements the correct\nwrapper.\n\nHow do I select PyQt4 or PySide?\n========================================\n\nYou can choose either PyQt4 or PySide when using the `qt4` backend by setting\nthe appropriate value for `backend.qt4` in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file. The\ndefault value is `PyQt4`.\n\nThe setting in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file can be overridden by setting the\n`QT_API` environment variable to either `pyqt` or `pyside` to use `PyQt4` or\n`PySide`, respectively.\n\nSince the default value for the bindings to be used is `PyQt4`,\n:mod:`matplotlib` first tries to import it, if the import fails, it tries to\nimport `PySide`.\n\n\nWhat is interactive mode?\n===================================\n\nUse of an interactive backend (see `what-is-a-backend`)\npermits--but does not by itself require or ensure--plotting\nto the screen.  Whether and when plotting to the screen occurs,\nand whether a script or shell session continues after a plot\nis drawn on the screen, depends on the functions and methods\nthat are called, and on a state variable that determines whether\nmatplotlib is in \"interactive mode\".  The default Boolean value is set\nby the :file:`matplotlibrc` file, and may be customized like any other\nconfiguration parameter (see `sphx_glr_tutorials_01_introductory_customizing.py`).  It\nmay also be set via :func:`matplotlib.interactive`, and its\nvalue may be queried via :func:`matplotlib.is_interactive`.  Turning\ninteractive mode on and off in the middle of a stream of plotting\ncommands, whether in a script or in a shell, is rarely needed\nand potentially confusing, so in the following we will assume all\nplotting is done with interactive mode either on or off.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Major changes related to interactivity, and in particular the\n   role and behavior of :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.show`, were made in the\n   transition to matplotlib version 1.0, and bugs were fixed in\n   1.0.1.  Here we describe the version 1.0.1 behavior for the\n   primary interactive backends, with the partial exception of\n   *macosx*.</p></div>\n\nInteractive mode may also be turned on via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ion`,\nand turned off via :func:`matplotlib.pyplot.ioff`.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Interactive mode works with suitable backends in ipython and in\n   the ordinary python shell, but it does *not* work in the IDLE IDE.\n   If the default backend does not support interactivity, an interactive\n   backend can be explicitly activated using any of the methods discussed in `What is a backend?`_.</p></div>\n\n\nInteractive example\n--------------------\n\nFrom an ordinary python prompt, or after invoking ipython with no options,\ntry this::\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.ion()\n    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n\nAssuming you are running version 1.0.1 or higher, and you have\nan interactive backend installed and selected by default, you should\nsee a plot, and your terminal prompt should also be active; you\ncan type additional commands such as::\n\n    plt.title(\"interactive test\")\n    plt.xlabel(\"index\")\n\nand you will see the plot being updated after each line.  This is\nbecause you are in interactive mode *and* you are using pyplot\nfunctions. Now try an alternative method of modifying the\nplot.  Get a reference to the :class:`~matplotlib.axes.Axes` instance, and\ncall a method of that instance::\n\n    ax = plt.gca()\n    ax.plot([3.1, 2.2])\n\nNothing changed, because the Axes methods do not include an\nautomatic call to :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw_if_interactive`;\nthat call is added by the pyplot functions.  If you are using\nmethods, then when you want to update the plot on the screen,\nyou need to call :func:`~matplotlib.pyplot.draw`::\n\n    plt.draw()\n\nNow you should see the new line added to the plot.\n\nNon-interactive example\n-----------------------\n\nStart a fresh session as in the previous example, but now\nturn interactive mode off::\n\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.ioff()\n    plt.plot([1.6, 2.7])\n\nNothing happened--or at least nothing has shown up on the\nscreen (unless you are using *macosx* backend, which is\nanomalous).  To make the plot appear, you need to do this::\n\n    plt.show()\n\nNow you see the plot, but your terminal command line is\nunresponsive; the :func:`show()` command *blocks* the input\nof additional commands until you manually kill the plot\nwindow.\n\nWhat good is this--being forced to use a blocking function?\nSuppose you need a script that plots the contents of a file\nto the screen.  You want to look at that plot, and then end\nthe script.  Without some blocking command such as show(), the\nscript would flash up the plot and then end immediately,\nleaving nothing on the screen.\n\nIn addition, non-interactive mode delays all drawing until\nshow() is called; this is more efficient than redrawing\nthe plot each time a line in the script adds a new feature.\n\nPrior to version 1.0, show() generally could not be called\nmore than once in a single script (although sometimes one\ncould get away with it); for version 1.0.1 and above, this\nrestriction is lifted, so one can write a script like this:\n\n"
